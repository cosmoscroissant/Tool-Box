# Analyzer
## pseudo-C
pseudo_C_analyzer.py is for organizing pseudo-C generated by IDA. It will look for a file named 0 (entry point), and start from there. It goes through each function and generate 4 files according to "pseudo_C_analyzer_lib.txt", which provides functions and non-function filters.
- "all_function.txt" for all functions mentioned in the provided codebase
- "missing_functions.txt" for later checkouts
- "organized_code.txt" for a clean, complete code output
- "flow_chart.txt" for complete call graph to view function relationships

f.y.i. pseudo_C_analyzer.py will delete these 4 files before creating new ones.

### How-To
`python3 pseudo_C_analyzer.py <path>`
