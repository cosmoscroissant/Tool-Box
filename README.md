# Tool Box
## Analyzer
### pseudo-C
pseudo_C_analyzer.py is for organizing pseudo-C generated by IDA. It will look for a file named 0 (entry point), and start from there. It goes through each function and generate 4 files according to "lib.txt", which provides functions and non-function filters.
- "all_function.txt" for all functions mentioned in the provided codebase
- "missing_functions.txt" for later checkouts
- "organized_code.txt" for a clean, complete code output
- "flow_chart.tx"t for complete call graph to view function relationships

f.y.i. pseudo_C_analyzer.py will delete these 4 files before creating new ones.

### How-To
`python3 pseudo_C_analyzer.py <path>`

## Sniffer
### ASM Footprint
asm_footprint_sniffer.py generates report containing hashes of the files and IoCs.
- hashes: IDA generate hashes
- protocols_full: well formed URLs
- urls: malformed or partial URLs
- domains: standalone domain names without protocols
- files
    - executable: exe, dll, scr, pif, com
    - sript: bat, cmd, vbs, js, ps1, sh, php
    - archives: zip, rar, 7z, jar
- main_patterns: functions and variables names that includes "main"
- ssh_patterns: referenced SSH client
- openssh_full: catches identity spoofing (complete email address)
- operational_files: files that carried out the operation
- dependency_paths: dependency in used 

### How-To
`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <file_path> -o report.txt`

`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <directory_path> -r -o report.txt`

`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <file_path> -o report.json -f json`

`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <directory_path> -r -o report.json -f json`
