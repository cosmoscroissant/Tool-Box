# Tool Box
## Downloader
### Malware Sample Downloader
sample_downloader.py will log in to virus.exchange and download the malware samples that are shown on the web page. It will refresh every 15 seconds to check for new samples. Before running the script, please change these three values:
- `USERNAME = "your_username_here"`
- `PASSWORD = "your_password_here"`
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR = r"your_path_here"`

### How-To
`python3 sample_downloader.py`

## Analyzer
### pseudo-C
pseudo_C_analyzer.py is for organizing pseudo-C generated by IDA. It will look for a file named 0 (entry point), and start from there. It goes through each function and generate 4 files according to "lib.txt", which provides functions and non-function filters.
- "all_function.txt" for all functions mentioned in the provided codebase
- "missing_functions.txt" for later checkouts
- "organized_code.txt" for a clean, complete code output
- "flow_chart.tx"t for complete call graph to view function relationships

f.y.i. pseudo_C_analyzer.py will delete these 4 files before creating new ones.

### How-To
`python3 pseudo_C_analyzer.py <path>`

## Sniffer
### ASM Footprint
asm_footprint_sniffer.py generates report containing hashes of the files and IoCs.
- hashes: IDA generate hashes
- protocols_full: well formed URLs
- urls: malformed or partial URLs
- domains: standalone domain names without protocols
- files
    - executable: exe, dll, scr, pif, com
    - sript: bat, cmd, vbs, js, ps1, sh, php
    - archives: zip, rar, 7z, jar
- main_patterns: functions and variables names that includes "main"
- ssh_patterns: referenced SSH client
- openssh_full: catches identity spoofing (complete email address)
- operational_files: files that carried out the operation
- dependency_paths: dependency in used 

### How-To
`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <file_path> -o report.txt`

`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <directory_path> -r -o report.txt`

`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <file_path> -o report.json -f json`

`python3 asm_footprint_sniffer.py <directory_path> -r -o report.json -f json`
